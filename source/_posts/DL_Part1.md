## vectorizing logistic regression

## Why we like to use that cost function for logistic regression?
- maximum likelihood estimation
- by minimizing this cost function J(w,b) we're really carrying out maximum likelihood estimation with the logistic regression model. Under the assumption that our training examples were IID, or identically independently distributed.
